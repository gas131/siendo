Note: by default, React will be in development mode, which is slower, and not advised for production. To use React in production mode, set the environment variable NODE_ENV to production (using envify or webpack's DefinePlugin). For example:

new webpack.DefinePlugin({
  "process.env": {
    NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify("production")
  }
});
